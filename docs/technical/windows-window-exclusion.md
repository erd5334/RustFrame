# Windows Window Exclusion (Planned)

## Status
Windows window exclusion is not implemented. This document describes a possible future approach and is not current behavior.

## Notes
- Windows Graphics Capture does not provide a native per-window exclusion API for region capture.
- Any implementation would need OS-level support or a custom compositing strategy.
