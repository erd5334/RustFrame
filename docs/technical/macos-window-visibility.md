# macOS Window Visibility (Historical Notes)

This file contained exploratory notes about preview window visibility in screen sharing pickers. The current implementation uses a normal-level NSWindow and relies on on-screen visibility for shareability. Details of past experiments are not maintained here.

See src/destination_window/macos.rs for the current behavior.
