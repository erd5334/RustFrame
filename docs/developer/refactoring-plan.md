# Refactoring Plan (Historical)

This file is a proposal and is not implemented in the current codebase. It is kept for reference only.

Planned themes:
- Unify platform window configuration types.
- Standardize border/indicator traits across platforms.
- Reduce duplicated platform logic.
- Prepare Linux skeleton implementations.
