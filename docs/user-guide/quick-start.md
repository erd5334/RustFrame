# Quick Start

1. Launch RustFrame.
2. Click Settings.
3. Open the Region tab and enable Preview Border.
4. Drag and resize the border to the region you want to share.
5. Click Start Capture.
6. In your video call app, share the preview window:

   - macOS: "Rust - Share This Window"

Notes:
- You can move and resize the border during capture.
- The preview window is the one you should share, not the border window.
