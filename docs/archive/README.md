# Archive

This folder contains historical, experimental, or deprecated documentation from the RustFrame project. These documents are preserved for reference and to avoid repeating past mistakes. Each file includes a short note on why it was archived.

- Documents here may describe approaches that were tried and abandoned, or contain technical context that is no longer current but may be useful for future reference.
- For up-to-date documentation, see the main docs/ sections.
