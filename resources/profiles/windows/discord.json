  "explanation": "Discord requires windows to be visible in taskbar to detect them. This profile uses WS_POPUP (no title bar) with WS_EX_APPWINDOW to appear in taskbar for 15 seconds, giving user time to select the window in Discord. After 15 seconds, it automatically hides from taskbar but continues sharing.",
